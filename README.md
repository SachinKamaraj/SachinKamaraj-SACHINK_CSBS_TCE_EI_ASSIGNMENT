# Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design Patterns
The first part of the repository contains the implementation of 6 use cases based on Design patterns using Java. Each use case contains the Explanatory.txt file, along with the source code with each class in separate files.

# Creational Design Pattern

1. Factory Pattern - Implementation of Document Management System: The Factory Pattern is used to create different types of documents (Word, PDF, Excel) without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

2. Builder Pattern - Implementation of Computer Builder System: The Builder Pattern is used to construct complex Computer objects step by step, allowing the creation of different configurations of computers with optional parts.

# Structural Design Pattern

1. Adapter Pattern - Implementation of Payment Gateway System: The Adapter Pattern is used to integrate multiple third-party payment gateways with different interfaces into a unified PaymentProcessor interface.

2. Facade Pattern - Implementation of Home Theatre Management System: The Facade Pattern is used to simplify the interaction with a complex subsystem (Home Theatre) by providing a unified interface for starting and controlling various devices like TV, sound system, and DVD player.

# Behavioral Design Pattern

1. Observer Pattern - Implementation of Stock Market Notification System: The Observer Pattern is used to notify registered observers (users) about changes in the stock market (e.g., price updates) in real-time.

2. Strategy Pattern - Implementation of Sorting System: The system uses the Strategy Pattern to dynamically select and execute different sorting algorithms. It enables flexible and efficient data organization by allowing easy switching between sorting strategies.

# Exercise 2: Problem Statements for Mini-projects
The second part of the repository contains the implementation of Mini project using Java. It ontains the Explanatory.txt file, UML Diagram along with the source code with each class in separate files.

# Virtual Classroom Manager: 
An EdTech platform that automates classroom management, enabling admins to add staff and students, faculty to create courses, students to enroll and view details, and faculty to manage attendance and assignments efficiently.The system utilizes the concept of SOLID principles, design patterns, and OOP to ensure smooth and efficient operation, with patterns like Factory for user creation and Singleton for Admin management.
